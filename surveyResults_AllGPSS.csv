This is almost always a shitshow; you follow the shuttle on your phone or try to make out landmarks to see when the bus is near your stop. You try to anticipate where the bus will turn or go straight to know when to get off. Some shuttle drivers are very good at this; they write down the stops, figure out a route, and then call out each stop when they get there. Everyone should be doing this and it would be MUCH easier for bus drivers if they were able to use some sort of gps or interactive map or something to help them figure out the best routes.

If someone spends an entire day in New York City, it is pretty common to head back to New Haven on a 11:00pm train (or even later), which means that one arrives at New Haven Union Station no earlier than 1:00am. By this time the routed shuttle has stopped running and in order to be picked up, you must wait for the door-to-door shuttle. Wait teams are typically 30 minutes or more. The problem with this is that area feels incredibly unsafe at night and there is very little security personnel present there. At certain hours, the train station is closed and you must wait on the sidewalk. I am almost always approached by vagrants in dimly lit areas. Of all of the places, I routinely frequent in New Haven, I feel most unsafe at the train station during the late hours. Since the arrival times of inbound Metro North trains are predictable, I think that the dispatch for the door-to-door shuttle service should make train station pick-ups a priority (or even have a dedicated shuttle to old campus) because it feels unsafe to wait there.","No, I wouldn't be interested",,No,No,,No,,Yes,Yes,Unknown

People can walk a couple blocks. Also the night service for the fixed route allow people to ask to be dropped of at a specific address. Thus the shuttle deviates from its normal route making it impossible to rely on the shuttle as it might miss the stop you are waiting at. Also, if you are already on the shuttle, it's a huge waste of time.

I cannot tell you how many times I've been passed over due to a full shuttle either at the Cafe Romeo stop (Blue/Orange) at the ""bottom"" of East Rock, or even at the Science Hill parking lot/Peabody stops. 

It is ridiculous that *five* consecutive buses can pass by at *both* stops during peak hours and pick up *zero* passengers... to not take this into account has really puzzled me for a long time. It doesn't matter if I try to get on a bus 1.5 hours (!) before I have to reach my destination, on many occasions I'll *still* be late for an appointment or class.

The best solution I can think of would be an express shuttle that goes directly from the heavily residential northern part of East Rock to the medical school, bypassing the middle of East Rock. I have faith that you have logged shuttle usage, and anecdotally I would assume that > 50% of passengers do not get on/off in areas near Cafe Romeo/Science Hill and all throughout undergrad campus.

Currently, the Orange night stops at Amistad for a very long time, during which time no prediction is displayed for it's arrival at 333 Cedar. For some reason, the Rider App thinks the bus has gone off route--so it disappears, making it impossible to know when the next one will arrive.  When the bus does come to 333 Cedar, it barely stops long enough for people to get on, and does not wait even if passengers are running to visibly to catch the bus.  The majority of orange night riders get on at 333 Cedar Street, with the bus most often arriving at this stop completely empty or with only 1-2 passengers.  It would benefit more passengers if the bus took whatever pause or break it takes at 333 Cedar street instead of the Amistad building. 

Additionally, the last orange night bus is listed as leaving 333 Cedar at 10:45 PM, but often arrives and leaves before 10:35--please make sure this bus sticks to its schedule--or do not post a schedule for this route.

The reasoning they gave was because my friend was impeding resources for ""studying law students"" who were going to the school ""for good reasons."" We all found this preposterous - law students use our shuttle for all sorts of reasons, including getting to and from social events. Forestry students and undergrads get on our shuttle all the time as well. Because it was a 50 minute wait for the door to door shuttle, our friend ended up walking to join us from her relatively dangerous area, alone, at 10PM. 

Those of us who heard about this would like clarification as to whether we're actually only allowed to use our law school shuttle to ""go study"" - which seems ridiculous and would be impossible to practically enforce. If this is NOT the actual policy, which I hope it isn't, I hope it's made clear to all the shuttle dispatchers from here on in. 

In general, the shuttle dispatchers tend to be very short-tempered, which I know has dissuaded many friends from calling them, choosing to walk through dangerous areas instead. ","No, I wouldn't be interested",,No,No,,No,,Yes,Yes,
