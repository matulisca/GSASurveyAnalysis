If someone spends an entire day in New York City, it is pretty common to head back to New Haven on a 11:00pm train (or even later), which means that one arrives at New Haven Union Station no earlier than 1:00am. By this time the routed shuttle has stopped running and in order to be picked up, you must wait for the door-to-door shuttle. Wait teams are typically 30 minutes or more. The problem with this is that area feels incredibly unsafe at night and there is very little security personnel present there. At certain hours, the train station is closed and you must wait on the sidewalk. I am almost always approached by vagrants in dimly lit areas. Of all of the places, I routinely frequent in New Haven, I feel most unsafe at the train station during the late hours. Since the arrival times of inbound Metro North trains are predictable, I think that the dispatch for the door-to-door shuttle service should make train station pick-ups a priority (or even have a dedicated shuttle to old campus) because it feels unsafe to wait there.","No, I wouldn't be interested",,No,No,,No,,Yes,Yes,Unknown

I cannot tell you how many times I've been passed over due to a full shuttle either at the Cafe Romeo stop (Blue/Orange) at the ""bottom"" of East Rock, or even at the Science Hill parking lot/Peabody stops. 

It is ridiculous that *five* consecutive buses can pass by at *both* stops during peak hours and pick up *zero* passengers... to not take this into account has really puzzled me for a long time. It doesn't matter if I try to get on a bus 1.5 hours (!) before I have to reach my destination, on many occasions I'll *still* be late for an appointment or class.

The best solution I can think of would be an express shuttle that goes directly from the heavily residential northern part of East Rock to the medical school, bypassing the middle of East Rock. I have faith that you have logged shuttle usage, and anecdotally I would assume that > 50% of passengers do not get on/off in areas near Cafe Romeo/Science Hill and all throughout undergrad campus. An express shuttle would alleviate some of this strain. ",Yale provided graduate students with cheaper/free passes,,No,No,,No,,No,Yes,Unknown

Currently, the Orange night stops at Amistad for a very long time, during which time no prediction is displayed for it's arrival at 333 Cedar. For some reason, the Rider App thinks the bus has gone off route--so it disappears, making it impossible to know when the next one will arrive.  When the bus does come to 333 Cedar, it barely stops long enough for people to get on, and does not wait even if passengers are running to visibly to catch the bus.  The majority of orange night riders get on at 333 Cedar Street, with the bus most often arriving at this stop completely empty or with only 1-2 passengers.  It would benefit more passengers if the bus took whatever pause or break it takes at 333 Cedar street instead of the Amistad building. 

Additionally, the last orange night bus is listed as leaving 333 Cedar at 10:45 PM, but often arrives and leaves before 10:35--please make sure this bus sticks to its schedule--or do not post a schedule for this route.
